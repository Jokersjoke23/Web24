    <title>Challenge: Write a Poem</title>

    <h1>Poem</h1>
    <p>
        Deutschland, Deutschland<br>
        Uber allen! Deutschland!<br>
        Mein Hertz in flammen!<br>
        Wir dich liebe, und verdammen<br>
    </p>

    <h1>You can learn text tags</h1>

        <strong>Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0.</strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</strong><br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>You only have to know one thing:</em><br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
